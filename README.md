# NI LabVIEW Test  

A repository for experimenting with **National Instruments LabVIEW**. This repo contains small projects built while learning and practicing **LabVIEW basics**.  

## Projects  

### 1. Timer State Machine
![](./projects/timer-state-machine/previews/block-diagram.png)  
- Implements a simple **state machine** that acts as a simple timer timer.  
- Demonstrates how to use states (e.g., Running, Stopped) and transitions.  


### 2. Counter State Machine
![](./projects/counter-state-machine/previews/block-diagram.png)  
- A state machine that behaves as a **counter**.  
- Shows how to increment and decrement values based on state transitions.
